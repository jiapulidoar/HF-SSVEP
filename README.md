# Asynchronous High-Frequency SSVEP Brain-Computer Interface in Virtual Reality 

This repository contains a collection of tools for analyzing and classifying Steady-State Visual Evoked Potential (SSVEP) Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) with high-frequency stimuli. It includes code for classification using Filter Bank Canonical Correlation Analysis (FBCCA) with filters specifically designed for frequencies in the 30 Hz and higher range.

Key features:
- SSVEP analysis tools for high-frequency stimuli
- FBCCA classification implementation
- Custom filter designs for 30+ Hz frequencies
- EEG data processing utilities
